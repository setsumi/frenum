About the Arrows

There are about 611 arrows. These are from several different sections of Unicode, including:

    Miscellaneous Symbols
    Dingbats
    Miscellaneous Mathematical Symbols-A
    Supplemental Arrows-A
    Supplemental Arrows-B
    Miscellaneous Mathematical Symbols-B
    Supplemental Mathematical Operators
    Miscellaneous Symbols and Arrows

It took me several days to collect and organize these arrows. They are scattered in different places, and are hard to find. Also, there are a lot symmetry issues, and some mirror image isn't there. Here's some details of my experience.

Note: each Unicode character has a ID called its “codepoint”. For example, → has codepoint 8594 or hexadecimal 2192.
Scattered All Over

They are scattered in different code blocks. The most common ones are collected in “Symbols, Arrows (2190–21FF)”. In the beginning of Unicode history, there's just a right pointing arrow of a particular style, because left pointing ones are seldomly or never used. But later, it's realized the left pointing ones are important too, for one reason or another, and sometimes there's a need just for completeness because Unicode became more wide spread. So, the left pointing ones get added, in the same block but different neighborhood, or in another block. Thus you have “Supplemental Arrows-A” and “Supplemental Arrows-B”. For similar reasons, other symmetric versions of the same style such as upward and or downward versions are scattered in wildly different blocks.

For example, here's some arrows and their names:
Codepoint	Char	Name	Date Added
U+2B05	⬅	LEFTWARDS BLACK ARROW	Unicode 4 (2003)
U+2B06	⬆	UPWARDS BLACK ARROW	Unicode 4 (2003)
U+2B07	⬇	DOWNWARDS BLACK ARROW	Unicode 4 (2003)

However, there was no “RIGHTWARDS BLACK ARROW” for about 10 years. The closest is this:
Codepoint	Char	Name	Date Added
U+27A1	➡	BLACK RIGHTWARDS ARROW
(old name: BLACK RIGHT ARROW)	Unicode 1 (1991)

You can see that, this right pointing arrow was there first. The others are added later. The names are inconsistent.

Finally, in Unicode 7, a new one with consistent name is added.
Codepoint	Char	Name	Date Added
U+2B95	⮕	RIGHTWARDS BLACK ARROW
	Unicode 7 (2014)

Now we have a ugly situation. There are 2 of them {➡, ⮕}. According to Unicode, they should be rendered in the same style as the other 3 for up/left/down. But, as of 2017-10-11, only the first one is rendered in the same style.
Missing Symmetric Versions

Lots of these arrows are from math, but some are also used elsewhere. The problem is, it's hard to categorize them into one place. So, in Unicode, the arrows gets into one of these blocks: “Miscellaneous Mathematical Symbols-B”, “Supplemental Mathematical Operators”, “Miscellaneous Symbols and Arrows”. Often, the left/right pair and the up/down pair are in different blocks.

Here's a example: ⇺ ⇻ ⇼ ⇞ ⇟. There does not seem to have a vertical version of ⇼. The chars ⇞ ⇟ are in category “Symbol, other”, while ⇺ ⇻ ⇼ are in category “Symbol, Math”.

Another example: ⥂ ⥃ ⥄. Note that there is no right pointing version of ⥄ as of 2017-10-11 (Unicode 10) .

Many arrows do not have symmetric versions. Symmetry here can be reflection thru vertical or horizontal axes, or n*90° rotation, or combination of them. The following are some set of chars missing symmetric versions: ↴ ↵ ↸ ↹ ⤺ ⤻ ⤼ ⤽ ⤪ ⤨ ⤧ ⤩ ⤭ ⤮ ⤯ ⤰ ⤱ ⤲.
Ordering Problem

Also, when trying to order them, i ran into the problem of devising a ordering scheme. For example, usually i order them by left right up down, like this:. ← → ↑ ↓. But now look at these: ⇆ ⇄ ⇅ ⇵. For the vertical pair, which should come first?

Here's another example of the complexity. There are these chars:
Character	Unicode Name
↶	ANTICLOCKWISE TOP SEMICIRCLE ARROW
↷	CLOCKWISE TOP SEMICIRCLE ARROW
⤾	LOWER RIGHT SEMICIRCULAR CLOCKWISE ARROW
⤿	LOWER LEFT SEMICIRCULAR ANTICLOCKWISE ARROW
⤸	RIGHT-SIDE ARC CLOCKWISE ARROW
⤹	LEFT-SIDE ARC ANTICLOCKWISE ARROW
⤺	TOP ARC ANTICLOCKWISE ARROW
⤻	BOTTOM ARC ANTICLOCKWISE ARROW

If you analyze their names, you can see that a circle can be divided into 8 arcs: {left, right, top, bottom}, and 4 of the diagonal arcs. Each arc can be clockwise or anti-clockwise. 8 arcs, 2 directions, there are a combination of 16 possibilities. First of all, note that not all of them is present. (For example, there's no char named “TOP ARC CLOCKWISE ARROW”) But given these chars, how do you order them?
Font Problems

Note that some left/right pairs looks very different, even in the same font.

For example, here's how they render in your browser:
Character	Code Point	Unicode Name
⬾	U+2B3E	LEFTWARDS ARROW THROUGH X
⥇	U+2947	RIGHTWARDS ARROW THROUGH X
⬲	U+2B32	LEFT ARROW WITH CIRCLED PLUS
⟴	U+27F4	RIGHT ARROW WITH CIRCLED PLUS
⬳	U+2B33	LONG LEFTWARDS SQUIGGLE ARROW
⟿	U+27FF	LONG RIGHTWARDS SQUIGGLE ARROW
⬱	U+2B31	THREE LEFTWARDS ARROWS
⇶	U+21F6	THREE RIGHTWARDS ARROWS

How the chars shows up on your screen may be very different from another person. It depends on your operating system, web browser, your browser and OS configuration, and availability of font on your system.

Typically, the rightward versions have correctly designed fonts, because it is far more popularly used. The leftward version, or other directions, sometimes get added as afterthought or extensions.
